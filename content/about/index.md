Hey! I'm Howard, a freelance photographer and front-end developer based in Toronto, Ontario. I'm also currently a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa.

I've been doing photography since 2012, when my dad gave me a small point-and-shoot. Ever since then, I've been quite passionate about photography, and currently work as a freelance photographer in event and portrait photography.

I've been programming for around 4 years, and I'm proficient in a plethora of languages such as Java, Python, and C#. I've been using Flutter since its beta in early 2018, and have been developing mobile applications primarily with Flutter. I'm currently working on my web development and UX design skills, having designed this website with Figma, creating this website using Gatsby and using Firebase Firestore to create a backend for my portfolio.
