## About the website

This website was made as my first project working with web technologies. The foundation of this website was built by analysing and modifying <a href="https://github.com/bchiang7/v4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Brittiany Chiang's website v4</a>, and building extensively off of that.
